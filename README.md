# tabnine-rust-community-model
Hello Rustaceans! Please feel free to submit a PR to add high quality Rust repos, to help us build and train a custom Rust model for the community.
## How can you help out ?
You can look at the example.csv file, which has a few Rust repos in it.
Please add your own csv to this repo with your suggested public Rust repos so we can train on them and improve the model for you guys!
Thanks for your help!
