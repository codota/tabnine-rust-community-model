# tabnine-rust-community-model
Hello Rustaceans! Add your favorite rust repos, to help us build and train a custom Rust model for the community.
## How can you help out ?
Attached is an example of a csv file with repos inside.
Please add your own csv to this repo with your suggested public Rust repos so we can train on them and improve the model accordingly.
Thanks for your help!
